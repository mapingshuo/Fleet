# Fleet
**Fleet** is High-Level API for distributed training in PaddlePaddle. The name of **Fleet** means that a large crowd of ships working together to finish a large scale job. The design of **Fleet** makes a trade-off between easy-to-use and algorithmic extensibility. First, a user can shift from single machine paddle fluid code to distributed code within ten lines of code. Second, different algorithms can be easily defined through distributed strategy through **Fleet** API.
